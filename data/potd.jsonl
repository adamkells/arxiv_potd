{"title":"DualCast: Disentangling Aperiodic Events from Traffic Series with a Dual-Branch Model","abstract":"Traffic forecasting is an important problem in the operation and optimisation\nof transportation systems. State-of-the-art solutions train machine learning\nmodels by minimising the mean forecasting errors on the training data. The\ntrained models often favour periodic events instead of aperiodic ones in their\nprediction results, as periodic events often prevail in the training data.\nWhile offering critical optimisation opportunities, aperiodic events such as\ntraffic incidents may be missed by the existing models. To address this issue,\nwe propose DualCast -- a model framework to enhance the learning capability of\ntraffic forecasting models, especially for aperiodic events. DualCast takes a\ndual-branch architecture, to disentangle traffic signals into two types, one\nreflecting intrinsic {spatial-temporal} patterns and the other reflecting\nexternal environment contexts including aperiodic events. We further propose a\ncross-time attention mechanism, to capture high-order spatial-temporal\nrelationships from both periodic and aperiodic patterns. DualCast is versatile.\nWe integrate it with recent traffic forecasting models, consistently reducing\ntheir forecasting errors by up to 9.6% on multiple real datasets.","authors":["Xinyu Su","Feng Liu","Yanchuan Chang","Egemen Tanin","Majid Sarvi","Jianzhong Qi"],"url":"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18286v1","published":"2024-11-27"}
